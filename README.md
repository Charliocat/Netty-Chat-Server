# Netty-Chat-Server
Simple netty chat server &amp; client

# Development Log

# Version 0.10 May 19, 2017
 - Right now just messing around with trying to get a simple echo server working on localhost.
 - Managed to host the server on EC2 after toying around with Linux commands.
 - Realized that we need to probably make this a REST API type of service for it to be cross platform.
